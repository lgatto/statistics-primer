### Lecture/practical content

Introducing basic concepts in statistics: experimental design,
randomisation, technical and biological variation, power analysis,
hypothesis testing, confidence interval, what is a p-value, false
discovery rate, multiple testing adjustment, Bayesian statistics,
dangers of uninformed statistical practice.

### Tools, databases and resources covered (if applicable)

Illustration/demonstration of some of the concepts seen in the lecture
using the R statistical environment. 

### Learning objectives

Familiarise students with basic statistical concepts and initiate them
to statistical thinking. They should be able to critically assess an
experimental design and the reporting of a simple statistical analysis.
